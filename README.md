# Text Analyzer

A simple Python script that allows a user to analyze predefined texts.  
The program calculates statistics such as the number of words, titlecase words, uppercase words, lowercase words, numeric strings, and the sum of all numbers in the selected text.  
It also generates a simple column chart showing the frequency of word lengths.

No additional libraries are required (uses standard Python libraries).

Usage:
Run the script from the command line:

python main.py
The program will ask you to enter a username and password.
Registered users in the script are:

mike / password123
liz / pass123

Next, select a text by entering a number between 1 and 3.
The program will analyze the chosen text and display statistics and a chart.
